# Introduction
Punctuality statistics of a flight provide valuable information about the on-time performance of a specific flight or an airline. Here are some key insights that can be derived from punctuality statistics:

1. On-Time Performance: Punctuality statistics indicate how often a flight or airline arrives at its destination on time, which is typically defined as being within a certain number of minutes of the scheduled arrival time (e.g., within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time). This information is crucial for passengers who want to plan their travel schedules efficiently.

2. Delays: Punctuality statistics reveal the frequency and duration of delays for a flight or airline. Delays can occur due to various reasons, such as weather conditions, air traffic congestion, mechanical issues, or operational challenges. Understanding the extent of delays helps passengers assess the reliability of a particular flight or airline.

3. Flight Cancellations: Punctuality statistics may also include information about flight cancellations. Cancellations can disrupt travel plans significantly, so knowing the cancellation rate of a flight or airline is essential for passengers.

4. Comparison Between Airlines: Passengers often use punctuality statistics to compare the performance of different airlines when selecting flights. Airlines with a strong track record of on-time arrivals may be more attractive to travelers.

These metrics are important for airlines and passengers to track as they provide insights into the operational reliability and performance of an airline, as well as potential disruptions to travelers' plans. Airlines aim to maximize the number of flights matched while minimizing the number of flights canceled and actual flights unmatched to provide a smooth and reliable travel experience for passengers.Travelers can use this information to make informed decisions about their travel plans, and airlines can use it to improve their operations and enhance the passenger experience.

# Data Analysis
Different data analysis strategies are used to analyse the dataset provided: 

### 1. Data Aggregation:
Helps describe the data, and generate insight from the characteristic of the data.
A customer might want to look into the performance in terms of punctuality based on different flight lines, punctuality and data should aggregate based on flight lines.

#### 1. Measures of location:
Mean (Average of a data set), Median (middle value of the data set), Mode (most repeated number)
	
 	Ans: The overall flight as a delay of 190mins with a median of 22mins. 
  	Mode (Most occurrance) is no delay (0 mins) with 39 counts.
#### 2. Measures of spread:
To understand the spread and distribution of data. and to find outliers.

	Ans: base on the interquartile, there are 29 airline outliers which has delay time more than 182 minutes (MAX IQR).
